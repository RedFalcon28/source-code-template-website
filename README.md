# source-code-template-website
I dont know it's get finished yet, but I just develop this project until the design. 
This project is a programming course project, but I only made the website interface, because I only used HTML and CSS. Basically I have learned JAVASCRIPT, 
but I have not been able to integrate it into the website that I made. Is that enough? I mean when creating a Frontend project with only HTML and CSS?
